- You can sort books by *rating*, *number of pages* or *publishing year*.
- In **Pages to Read** page you can see the number of pages you read from your read book list in a charming triangular shaped chart.
- Initially only 6 books are shown on **Home Page**, but you can click on **Show All Books** button to see all the books.
